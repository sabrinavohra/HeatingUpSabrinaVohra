I thought about approaching it using either depth first search or breadth first search to find the various paths / numbers that could be included. |
| 1/14 | 10:30 - 10:50pm |   I started writing out pseudocode and tested out a small algorithm that moves through the list from different points and finds values that are greater than the previous values. The solution seems pretty close as it passes 4/5 tests, but the final test is off by a large margin. |
